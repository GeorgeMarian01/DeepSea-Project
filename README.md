# ‚ÑπÔ∏è About the project 
The DeepSea project was part of my training program at ITSchool, where I worked closely with my trainer, Radu Ni»õuc (Senior QA). The primary goal was to analyze the user creation functionality of the DeepSea website application and develop corresponding test cases to cover various user interactions.

Working on the DeepSea project significantly enhanced my skills in quality assurance and software testing. I gained hands-on experience in developing test strategies, writing detailed test cases, and analyzing technical specifications. The mentorship and guidance from Radu Ni»õuc were invaluable, providing me with insights into industry best practices and helping me refine my analytical and problem-solving abilities.
